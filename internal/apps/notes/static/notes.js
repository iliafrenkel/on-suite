// one a plain form already issues and a handler test in handlers_test.go
// already covers; N2 built and tested all of them before this file existed.
// It has no tests of its own, by design (spec §17): what a handler test
// cannot see is caret placement after a swap, which is verified by hand
// instead — see the final task's QA checklist.
